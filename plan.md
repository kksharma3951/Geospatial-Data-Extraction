# Geospatial Data Extraction App - Project Plan ✅

## Overview
Build a complete geospatial data extraction application with map visualization, data upload/extraction, coordinate conversion, analytics dashboard, and LiDAR processing capabilities.

---

## Phase 1: Core Map Interface and Layout ✅
**Goal**: Establish the base application structure with interactive map, sidebar navigation, and Material Design 3 UI framework.

- [x] Create main application layout with Material Design 3 components (app bar, sidebar, content area)
- [x] Implement interactive map component with pan, zoom, and click interactions
- [x] Add coordinate display and basic map controls (zoom in/out, reset view)
- [x] Build responsive sidebar with navigation menu for different features
- [x] Set up state management for map center, zoom level, and selected coordinates

---

## Phase 2: Data Upload and Extraction Features ✅
**Goal**: Enable users to upload geospatial files, extract data, and perform coordinate conversions.

- [x] Create file upload interface for geospatial formats (GeoJSON, KML, CSV with lat/lon)
- [x] Implement data parsing and validation for uploaded files
- [x] Build extraction interface with filters (bounding box, radius search, attribute filters)
- [x] Add coordinate conversion tools (WGS84, UTM, Web Mercator)
- [x] Display extracted data in interactive data table with sorting and filtering

---

## Phase 3: Analytics Dashboard and Data Visualization ✅
**Goal**: Provide comprehensive analytics and visualization of extracted geospatial data.

- [x] Create analytics dashboard page with summary statistics (point count, area coverage, data quality metrics)
- [x] Implement heatmap visualization for point density analysis on the map
- [x] Add chart components for attribute analysis (bar charts, line charts for temporal data)
- [x] Build data export functionality (CSV, GeoJSON, Excel formats)
- [x] Add data layers panel to toggle visibility of different datasets on the map

---

## Phase 4: LiDAR Data Processing and Visualization ✅
**Goal**: Add LiDAR point cloud processing, elevation analysis, and 3D visualization capabilities.

- [x] Create LiDAR upload page with support for LAS/LAZ file formats
- [x] Implement LiDAR point cloud parsing and metadata extraction (point count, elevation range, classification data)
- [x] Build elevation profile visualization with cross-section analysis tools
- [x] Add terrain analysis features (slope calculation, hillshade generation, contour extraction)
- [x] Create 3D point cloud viewer with color-coded elevation and classification visualization

---

## Phase 5: Advanced LiDAR Analysis Tools
**Goal**: Provide professional-grade LiDAR analysis capabilities for terrain and feature extraction.

- [ ] Implement ground point classification and Digital Terrain Model (DTM) generation
- [ ] Add vegetation height analysis (canopy height model from LiDAR returns)
- [ ] Build building/structure extraction from classified point clouds
- [ ] Create volume calculation tools for cut/fill analysis
- [ ] Add point cloud filtering and decimation for performance optimization

---

## Phase 6: LiDAR Data Export and Reporting
**Goal**: Enable users to export processed LiDAR data and generate analysis reports.

- [ ] Implement LiDAR data export (LAS, LAZ, DEM/GeoTIFF formats)
- [ ] Create elevation statistics report generator (min/max/mean elevation, standard deviation)
- [ ] Add 3D model export (OBJ, PLY formats for external visualization)
- [ ] Build interactive comparison tools for multi-temporal LiDAR datasets
- [ ] Generate PDF reports with elevation profiles, statistics, and visualizations
